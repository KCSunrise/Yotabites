DATA ANALYSIS FOR PURCHASES CHALLENGE
1.	Methodology for exploring data was to look at summary stats, and regression analysis in excel to get a feel for what the data might show.
Purchased	No Purchase	Total
143	257	400
36%	64%	100%
		

Female = 1	Male = 0	Total
196	204	400
49%	51%	100%

Differences in Purchase patterns between genders
	Female	Male	total
No Purchase	130	127	257
Purchase	66	77	143
Total	196	204	400

Conditional Probability of Purchase
Prob[Purchased/given female] = 66/196 = 34%
Prob[purchased/given male] = 77/204 = 38 %
Conditional probability for Males is a little higher than females

Purchased = -.9041 +.0266Age + 3.84E-06EstimatedSalary -.01619Gender
Using observation 220 from Residuals
Purchase = -.9041 + .0266(59years) + 3.84E-06 (143000) - -0619(1)
Purchase = 1.21 (i.e. 121%)
2.	LPM estimates probability of purchase (insights)
Age explanatory variable: .0266 means for every additional year probability of purchase increases by 2.66%
Salary explanatory variable: 3.84E-06 (10000) = .0380
For every $10,000 increase in salary probability of purchase increases by 3.80%
Since the sign on the gender explanatory variable is negative this means that being a male decreases probability of purchase (This contradicts conditional probability analysis).
Being a male decreases probability of purchase by 1.62%
Since linear regression is unbounded as Estimated Salary(ES) goes up probability goes up. If ES goes up to $1milliion, probability of purchase goes up to 380%.  
	
3.	Data preparation for a successful classification model
Since the data was munged for the most part, the only changes made were using a dummy variable (0,1) for the Male and Female binary classification. 
Also the initial linear regression modeling was done using Excel
4.	Motivation/rationale for the model choices you made.
Using three different modeling techniques Classification and Random forest, KNN, and Logistic regression I found that the model that predicts the purchase behavior of both male and female is best predicted by the Classification and Random Forest Model closely replicated by the Logistic Regression Model.  
Based on the following output:
[(0.5247026447869194, 'Age'),
 (0.465271178934293, 'EstimatedSalary'),
 (0.01002617627878783, 'Gender')]
 Age and Salary seems to predict purchase behavior better than gender. This also closely resembles the conditional probability model explained above.
